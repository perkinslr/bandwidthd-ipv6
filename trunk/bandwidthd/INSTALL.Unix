#### INSTALLATION #

You need 3 dependencies to make Bandwidthd work:

libpcap from http://www.tcpdump.org/
libpng from http://www.libpng.org/
libgd from http://www.boutell.com/gd/

Chances are you already have all three, if in doubt
just run configure and see what it complains about. If 
you are missing libpng, make sure you re-install libgd
after you install it.

Configure and install the Bandwidthd source:

./configure && make install

Edit /usr/local/bandwidthd/etc/bandwidthd.conf to suit
your network.  Start Bandwidthd.   See README for
details and information on stand alone vs database driven mode.
